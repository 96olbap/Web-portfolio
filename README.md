## Description
This project was built for the purpose of creating my very first Programming Web Portfolio.
The project was solely condycted by me following extensive research on how to make a programming web portfolio.
The project consists of an index.html file which acts as the landing page; Home page for the web portfolio, which contains a navigation bar to enable users to easily navigate the site.
In the navigation bar are links to all the other pages in the portfolio namely: About Me, My Projects(projects I've pushed onto github thus far) and a Contact me page where any user who wishes to contact me can send a message.

## Setup
Open your browser and load https://96olbap.github.io/Web-portfolio/ to view my portfolio.
