      <div class="card-body">
        <p>I was born on the 29th of June 1999,in Bungoma county, Kenya.<br>
        Went to primary school between the year 2006 and 2013 at the Nzoia Sugar Co. Pri. School where I sat for my Kenya Certificate of primary Education (KCSE)<br>
        after which I was enrollled at the Alliance High School in the year 2014</p>
        <p>On completion of my Highschool studies at the esteemed school I managed to get enrolment at the University of Nairobi for a course in Computer Science.</p>
        <br>
        <p>From an early age I’ve always been deeply interested in computing. It was my elder brother, introducing me to the computer systems at his work place that first sparked this interest.<br>
        I can always remember the feeling of wanting to know just how computers worked, why they worked and what else they could do.<br> Over the years, this interest has grown to become an immense desire to bocome a software developer and thus the reason for my enrolment into Moringa coding school<br>
        where I believe is a great avenue for me to pursue my interests in software development.</p>
        <p>I also enjoy playing basketball during my free time and attending classic car events, being a car enthusiast and all. I desire dome day to own a custom 1967 Cadilac Eldorado,<br>
        quite the gem that one!</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card-footer">
        <p>To ensure that I can fit everything in I’ve had to develop very good time management, prioritising what I need to do efficiently.</p>
